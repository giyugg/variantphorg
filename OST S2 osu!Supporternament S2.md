5. The VERY FINAL match schedules for each round will be announced by the tournament managers on the discord server, as well as the information spreadsheet, on the following dates before the matches take place. Take note that the schedule here in this forum is not yet final as the players might change their match schedules and/or staff recommnends some dates and times to be set.
6. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable beatmap elements like storyboards and skins is allowed.
    - Custom skin elements must not be used to alter core gameplay elements or mechanics in unintended ways.
7. If the player didn't show up at the present match time, the match can be postponed for up to 10 minutes. If after this period and the player is not yet here, a *win by default* will be declared for the side with the earliest player present.
8. Exchanging players between games is not allowed in any grounds
    - Eg.: If the REAL player is not available and he or she likes to play it with the OTHER player in behalf of that REAL player. It's not allowed.
9.  If a game ends in a draw, it will be nullified and the beatmap will be replayed.
10. Players may ask for a rematch if a player encounters technical issues while playing within 30 seconds or 25% of the beatmap drain length (whichever happens first) of the game's start. Referees may, at their discretion, veto this request.
    - "Lag spikes" are not considered a valid reason to rematch a beatmap.
    - This rule is not to be abused. Referees may veto a rematch request if they find that this is the case.
11. If a player disconnects mid-game, their scores will not be counted towards their total score, unless adequate proof of said score is provided. The following are considered as acceptable proof:
    - Player point-of-view live stream snippets (commonly referred to as "clips" or "VODs"). The entirety of the play, along with the results screen must be clearly visible along with the affected player's score.
    - Replay files of the play, taken directly from the "Local scores" tab on the affected player's client (the timestamps must exactly match the time at which the game took place, as seen on the multiplayer lobby link).
    - Screenshots from other players taken directly in-game that show the affected player's score.
      - Screenshots from the results screen must clearly show the affected player's score. This is the preferred method.
      - Screenshots taken in-game at the time of disconnection may be accepted. Note that this method does not provide a one-to-one representation of that player's score. Using this method is not encouraged and it may be denied at the referee's discretion if the information provided is not sufficient to identify the player/score.
      - All screenshots **MUST** be taken using the game itself (using `Shift` + `F12`), that is, they must be hosted on the `https://osu.ppy.sh/` domain. Any other form of screenshot will be denied.
    - Player scores may be derived from the official stream as a last resort, in cases where the match is streamed.
12. Players are expected to keep the match running fluently and without delays. Excessive match delays from the players' side may result in penalties being applied by the tournament managers. Disrupting the match by foul play, insulting or provoking other players or staff, delaying the match, and other deliberate inappropriate misbehaviour are strictly prohibited, and will be punished accordingly.
13. Any attempts to manipulate bracket outcomes or future matchups may result in the immediate disqualification of the player from the competition. Examples of manipulative behavior include, but are not limited to:
    - Colluding with other players to force a desired matchup.
    - Deliberately playing poorly to lose a game or match.
    - Forfeiting bracket matches without providing an adequate reasoning, or with the intention of getting a more favourable matchup.
14. All players and staff must be treated with respect. Instructions from the referees and the tournament managers are to be followed. Decisions labelled as final are not to be objected.
